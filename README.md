# MU Online Discord Bot
MU Discord Bot (C++, C#, JavaScript [Node.Js], WPF, SQL) - A Discord Bot, Designed to communicate with a MU Online Game Server and Database.

- Server Side (Back-end, C++) - Opens a TCP Server on the MU Online GameServer Itself, used to communicate with the Discord Bot
Which is the front-end.

- Discord Bot (Front-end, JavaScript, SQL) - Starts a Discord Bot, Designed to communicate with the Server Side, with the user being able
to do so without being on the game itself. Meaning, it's a strong tool for Admins and Game Managers because they can
control the game without them being active through PC or Laptop. Like banning players.

- Discord Bot GUI (Front-end, C#, WPF) - A GUI I created to make config the bot easier for all admins that are using the bot,
and easier to manage it.
